# Demonstration of Convergence: Binomial vs Normal Distribution

## Introduction

The Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials. As the number of trials \( N \) increases, the shape of the Binomial distribution tends to resemble a Normal distribution.

## Method

- We generated random numbers from both the Binomial and Normal distributions for increasing values of \( N \).
- Each distribution was normalized (density=True) for easier comparison on the same plot.
- Histograms were plotted using `matplotlib` to visualize the distributions.

## Results

### Histograms

- **N = 10**: The Binomial distribution is noticeably discrete with a spread around the mean. The Normal distribution shows a smoother curve around the same mean.

- **N = 50**: The Binomial distribution starts to resemble a bell-shaped curve, approaching the shape of the Normal distribution.

- **N = 100**: The Binomial distribution closely approximates the Normal distribution, especially in terms of shape and spread.

- **N = 500 and N = 1000**: The Binomial distribution is virtually indistinguishable from the Normal distribution, confirming convergence in the large \( N \) limit.

## Conclusion

- As demonstrated through histograms and statistical theory, the Binomial distribution converges to the Normal distribution as the number of trials \( N \) increases. This convergence is a fundamental result in probability theory and has wide-ranging applications in statistics and modeling.
